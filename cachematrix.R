##  This code will demonstrate how to cache result of the inverse of a matrix calculation  
## by taking advantage of the scoping rules of the R language. It consists of 2 functions.
## The <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment that 
## is different from the current environment. Below are two functions that are used to create 
## a special object that stores a matrix and caches the inverse of a matrix

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## Whitch is really a list containing a function to
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse matrix
## get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
}
